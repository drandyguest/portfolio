# Dr Andrew Guest Academic Portfolio

## Role

I am a lecturer in the Computer Science department of York St John University.   

My main role is as Games Development Programme Lead, running the Games Development BSc(Hons) degree. This entails designing, developing and overseeing the Games Development specific modules. I recently took the Games degree through revalidation as part of the department's revalidations of its existing degrees.  

I am Academic Tutor for our games students, their first point of contact for any issues that are not module related and their second point of contact for module issues. This include issues to do with degree progression, resits, programme transfers and, where appropriate, pastoral issues related to student lives that affect their studies.   

I lecture on programming and games development topics. I run a module on object oriented programming in Java and most of the games modules we run (Games Fundamentals, Games Design, Game Engine Development, iOS Games Development). The revalidated Games Dev programme increases the number of games specific modules and my lecturing role will move to focusing on those module over the next three years.  

I supervise final year projects for our third year students.  

## Background

I graduated from Aberdeen University in 1996 with an honours degree in Computing Science. After graduation I worked in software development mostly in the oil industry in Aberdeen, supporting and developing systems for Shell and BP.  

I left industry due to health issues and went back to university in 2006 to study Computer Animation & Graphics Technology Applications at Teesside University. It was during this period I discovered a love of academia. After gaining my Masters I moved to Dundee to study for a PhD at Abertay University.  

My PhD was part of a research group entitled "The Emergence of Artificial Culture in Robot Societies", investigating if the dynamics of imitation in swarm systems could lead to the emergence of proto-cultural artifacts. My thesis examined how different types of imitation could affect the duplication of sound memes when the robots audibly imitated each other.  

Throughout my PhD I taught at various levels at Abertay. Initially I worked as a lab assistant for a variety of computing and games development modules, running tutorials and giving the occasional lecture. During my last three years at Abertay I developed, ran and assessed modules in Software Engineering and Computer Systems.  

I have played games of all kinds for as long as I can remember, board games from early childhood, video games from the late seventies and table-top RPGs since the early eighties. My time at Abertay (during my PhD) gave me the chance to get involved with teaching games development and that has become the focus of my academic career.  

I joined York St John at the start of the 2017/18 academic year.
