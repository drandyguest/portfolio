# Continuing Professional Development

## Professional Skills

Computing in general, and games development in particular is a fast changing industry. The software and technology involved is constantly changing. In the past year I have completed online courses on:

* Unity game engine
* Godot game engine
  
I've also had to teach myself iOS development using Xcode, Swift and SpriteKit.  
## International Game Developers Association (IGDA)

I'm a member of the [International Game Developers Association (IGDA)](https://igda.org/). IGDA is *"the worldâ€™s largest nonprofit membership organization serving all individuals who create games."* It exists to connect game developers, students, academics and others interested in games development. It seeks to promote professional development, networking and advocates for game developers.  

## British Computer Society (BCS) Accreditation
