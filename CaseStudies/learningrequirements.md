# Learning Requirements

## First Year Variation

As discussed in the pedagogy section students arrive at YSJ with a wide range of abilities in computing. Some have no experience beyond using a computer while others have been coding for years. The first major learning requirement we face is the challenge of getting every student to the same level for the start of second year. Bringing the least experienced students up to speed while keeping the most experienced students enganged requires careful management of module content. I find a problem based learning approach works best. Each session students are given a series of problems to solve. These begin simple, asking the students to implement concepts from the lectures, and become more complex through the exercises. Less experienced students are able to take their time and work up to the more complex problems, more adept students either work through the easier problems quickly or skip them entirely, moving directly to the more complex ones.  

Our students work on lab exercises in small groups of two to four and we encourage this. More experienced students are able to help les experienced ones and usually gain a deeper understanding themselves in doing so. Students of similar ability levels find their differing understandings of concepts enable them to solve problems they struggle with alone. This approach also neatly mirrors the industry practice of [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). This can lead to [marking issues](Marking.md).  

## Recorded Lectures

I began recording lectures during the Covid pandemic lockdown. This has proven popular with the students and I have continued recording videos of my lectures and assessment briefings since we have returned to face to face teaching. Students like to be able to review the lectures in their own time and at their own speed (literally!). The system used allows for the automatic generation of subtitles.  

## Learning Support Plans

YSJ supports students with specific learning requirements with [Learning Support Plans](https://www.yorksj.ac.uk/health-and-wellbeing/disability-support/learning-support/) (LSPs). Students are able to contact a Disability Practitioner and have and LSP put together to help us support their specific needs. YSJ are able to provide support such as:  

* Exam adjustments
* Specialist equipment and software
* Mentoring support or 1 to 1 specialist tuition
* Assistive technology training
* Library assistance
* Adaptations to accommodation. 

We generally have a number of LSPs for students in each year. We usually have a number of students on the Asperger's/Autism spectrum and regularly provide early access to lecture slides, extra time for assessments and exams and classroom accomodations relating to noise and group work.

>One former student was diagnosed with Autism but his LSP was unclear. In his first year one module had group work with which he did not engage so he failed the module (he passed the resit which had no group work). Before he started second year I met with him and his disability practitioner and we updated his LSP to be more informative and detailed. Specifically we included notes on how to help him with group work - that he needed specific and detailed directions. He did well in his second year module that involved group work. In his third year I was his major project supervisor. I met early on with the student and his mother (and again later on) and we went through exactly what the major project would involve. Again he was able to do well and graduated with a good degree.  

## Tutorial Sessions

I offer students bookable tutorial session, either face to face or through MS Teams.  
## Outreach

In addition to regularly taking part in YSJ Open Days I have been involved in outreach sessions with local schools and [Teen Tech](https://teentech.com/).
